# BgRemover-Elite
This code provides a function remove_background() to remove the background of images and save the result as PNG files. The code takes two arguments as inputs:

 input_path: the path of the directory that contains the input images
 output_path: the path of the directory to save the output images
How to Use the Function
1.Import the required libraries.
		import cv2
		import numpy as np
		import os
2.Call the remove_background() function and pass in the input_path and output_path as arguments.

input_path = "./input"
output_path = "./output"

remove_background(input_path, output_path)
How the Function Works
The function remove_background() loops through all the image files in the input_path directory and performs the following steps for each image file:

Read the image file with cv2.imread().
Convert the image from BGR color space to grayscale with cv2.cvtColor().
Apply Otsu's thresholding on the grayscale image to get a binary mask that separates the foreground and background.
Smooth the mask with median blur with cv2.medianBlur().
Invert the mask to get the background mask with cv2.bitwise_not().
Get the background by performing bitwise AND operation between a black image and the background mask.
Get the foreground by performing bitwise AND operation between the original image and the inverted mask.
Combine the foreground and background to get the final result with cv2.add().
Set the alpha channel of the result image to the mask to make the background transparent.
Save the result as a PNG file with cv2.imwrite().
Notes
The code only works with image files that have extensions of .jpg, .jpeg, and .png.
The function assumes that the input images are in BGR color space.
The function uses Otsu's thresholding to automatically determine the threshold value for the binary mask. This method may not work well for all images, and a manual threshold value may need to be set in some cases.
